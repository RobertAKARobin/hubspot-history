		<h1>Hubspot Snapshot</h1>

		<div id="display"></div>

		<h2>Explanation</h2>

		<p>This lets you download an Excel-friendly "snapshot" of all the Deals in Hubspot on a certain date.</p>
		
		<p>For example, let's say Deal 123 was $100 on July 1, and was changed to $250 on July 3. If you download a snapshot of July 2, it will show Deal 123 as being $100.</p>

		<p>After clicking the 'Download' button, this page's address will change. Copy the address and come back to it later, and the form above will be filled out for you.</p>
